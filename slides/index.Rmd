# Interactive visualisation for high-dimensional data analysis

---

# Motivation: non-linear dimensionality reduction methods

---

# Big picture: what do these methods do?

---

# Big picture: How are these methods used in the wild?

---
# Cluster orientation tasks

---

# Cluster idenfication, shapes, and verification

---

# Two approaches embeddings and tours

---

# Orientation with t-SNE

---

# Description

---

# How does it work?

---

# Important parameters

---

# t-SNE views

state of the art, mental map in high-dimensional plot
hold on to these ideas 

----

# Orientation with tours

---


# Description

---

# How does it work?

---



# Why do we need interactivity?

---

# Tours as streams

---

# How does this work?

---

# Hidden messages

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(liminal)
data(pollen, package = "animation")
limn_tour(pollen, cols = dplyr::everything())
```

---

# Hidden messages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# show output as video
mp4_vid
```

---

# Our approach: you can have it all

---

# Ensemble graphics

---

# Interactions

---

# Linked Brushing and Highlighting

---

# How do they work?

---

# Case study: High-dimensional trees

---

# Description

---

# Linked highlighting shows how t-SNE breaks topology

---

# Reparmeterising partially fixes the problem

---

# Linked Brushing identifies distortions

---

# Case study: QuickDraw

---

# Description

---

# When does a cat look like a dog?

---

# Limitations

---

# Spatially resolved brushes

---

# How do they work?

---
