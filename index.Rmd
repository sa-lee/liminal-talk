# Big picture: dimensionality reduction

.large[
Let $X$ be an $n \times p$ real data matrix, where $n$ is the number of observations in $p$ dimensions. 

The goal of dimensionality reduction (DR) is to find a low dimensional data representation $Y$, such that $Y$ is an $n \times d$ matrix where $d \ll p$.

.large[
_Aspiration: the DR procedure  will remove **noise** in the data while revealing **hidden patterns and structure**._
]

---
# DR approaches

.large[_Linear_: $Y$ is a linear transformation of the input $X$, i.e. principal components analysis (PCA).

_Non-linear_: $Y$ is generated via a pre-processed form of the input $X$ such as the $k$-nearest neighbours graph or a kernel transformation.

# How does it work?

.large[_Key idea:_ transform pairwise $\mathbf{x_i}$ and $\mathbf{x_j}$ 
distances to joint probabilities using a Gaussian kernel

$p_{i|j} = \frac{\exp(-\lVert \mathbf{x_i - x_j} \rVert ^ 2 / 2\sigma_i^2)}{\sum_{k \ne i}\exp(-\lVert \mathbf{x_j - x_k} \rVert ^ 2 / 2\sigma_i^2)}$ and $p_{ij} = \frac{p_{i|j} + p_{j|i}}{2}$

---

# How does it work?

.large[The variance $\sigma_{i}^2$ of the Gaussian is chosen based on user supplied value of perplexity:

$\text{perplexity}_i = \exp(-\log(2) \sum_{i \ne j}p_{j|i}\log_2(p_{j|i}))$

# t-SNE gives a lot of flexibility

.large[
- there's a lot of parameters to tweak
- emphasises locality, distance between clusters of points can be misleading
- size of clusters can be misleading 
- may require a few different runs to capture topology of data

# Orientation with tours

.large[

- a technique from statistical graphics
- has been successfully applied to problems in particle physics and model interpretation
- can be used to visualise $d \gt 3$ using $d = 1$ or $d=2$ views

]

---


# Description

.large[
Recall our $n \times p$ data matrix $X$

A tour is sequence of $p \times d$ orthonormal projection matrices (bases) $A_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $d$ is typically $1$ or $2$.

A tour allows us to explore the set of all $d$-dimensional subspaces via the projection of $X$ onto $A$. 
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[
We visualise the sequence of low dimensional projections:

$$Y_{t} = XA_{t}$$

as animated scatter or density plots. 
]

# Spatial linking


.large[

**distortion**: points that are far away in one view, will show neighbours that are close together in the opposing view.

**diffusion**: points that are close in one view, will show neighbours that are far apart in the opposing view.

# Spatial linking

.large[
**Key idea:** Look up nearest neighbours graph
from points that lie in a brushing region.

Highlight the corresponding neighbours using colour or transparency in the linked view.

# Spatial linking

.medium[
- The $k$ nearest neighbours graph can be pre-computed quickly, for either $X$, $Y$ or both.
- Instead of using the neighbour indices, we could use the neighbour distances instead.
- Composition of multiple brushes could be used to show where there are matches/mismatches between nearest neighbour graphs.
