# Big picture: dimensionality reduction

.large[
Let $X$ be an $n \times p$ real data matrix, where $n$ is the number of observations in $p$ dimensions. 

The goal of dimensionality reduction (DR) is to find a low dimensional data representation $Y$, such that $Y$ is an $n \times d$ matrix where $d \ll p$.   
]
---
class: middle

.large[
_Aspiration: the DR procedure  will remove **noise** in the data while revealing **hidden patterns and structure**._
]

---
# DR approaches

.large[_Linear_: $Y$ is a linear transformation of the input $X$, i.e. principal components analysis (PCA).

_Non-linear_: $Y$ is generated via a pre-processed form of the input $X$ such as the $k$-nearest neighbours graph or a kernel transformation.

# How does the algorithm work?

.large[_Key idea:_ use pairwise $\mathbf{x_i}$ and $\mathbf{x_j}$ 
distances as joint probabilities using a Gaussian kernel

$p_{i|j} = \frac{\exp(-\lVert \mathbf{x_i - x_j} \rVert ^ 2 / 2\sigma_i^2)}{\sum_{k \ne i}\exp(-\lVert \mathbf{x_j - x_k} \rVert ^ 2 / 2\sigma_i^2)}$ and $p_{ij} = \frac{p_{i|j} + p_{j|i}}{2}$
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[The variance $\sigma_{i}^2$ of the Gaussian is chosen based on user supplied value of perplexity:

$\text{perplexity}_i = \exp(-\log(2) \sum_{i \ne j}p_{j|i}\log_2(p_{j|i}))$

_The larger the value of perplexity, the larger the variance.
Perplexity controls the number of nearest neighbours._ 
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[
_Key idea:_ use pairwise distances $\mathbf{y_i}$ and $\mathbf{y_j}$ to form joint probabilities using a Cauchy kernel:

$$q_{ij} = \frac{w_{ij}}{Z}$$ 

where $w_{ij} = \frac{1}{ 1 + \lVert \mathbf{y_i - y_j} \rVert ^ 2}$ and $Z = \sum_{k \ne l} w_{kl}.$
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[
Obtain $Y$ so that Kullback-Leibler divergence between
the probability distributions $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ is minimised:

$$\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i \ne j} p_{ij} \log \frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}$$
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[
The loss function can be recast in terms of .red[attractive] and .blue[repulsive] forces:

$$\mathcal{L} = \color{red}{-\sum_{i \ne j} p_{ij}\log w_{ij}} + \color{blue}{\log\sum_{i \ne j} w_{ij}}$$

# t-SNE gives a lot of flexibility

- size of clusters can be misleading

# Orientation with tours

.large[

- a technique from statistical graphics
- has been successfully applied to problems in particle physics and model interpretation
- can be used to visualise $d \gt 3$ using $d = 1$ or $d=2$ views

]

---


# Description

.large[
Recall our $n \times p$ data matrix $X$

A tour is sequence of $p \times d$ orthonormal projection matrices (bases) $A_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $d$ is typically $1$ or $2$.

A tour allows us to explore the set of all $d$-dimensional subspaces via the projection of $X$ onto $A$. 
]

---

# How does it work?

.large[
We visualise the sequence of low dimensional projections:

$$Y_{t} = XA_{t}$$

as animated scatter or density plots. 
]

---

.large[**Grand Tour:** generate a set of random orthnormal bases, interpolate between them.]

```

---

# We need interactivity

.large[The tour is greatly enhanced by interactivity:

- play/pause the current projection
- zooming to find 'interesting' points
- highlighting sets of points
- linking between multiple views

# `liminal` an R package for interactive tours

- leverage client-side visualisation and interaction via `vegawidget`
- treats the basis generation/interpolation steps as a reactive stream

# The API and hidden messages

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

data(pollen, package = "animation")

```


---

# Demo #1, the secret word is...

---

# Tours as reactive streams

.large[
- don't need to realise the entire sequence
- instead generate new bases according to a fixed frame rate
- allows user interactions to play/pause on the current view

# Spatial Linked Brushes

**distortion**: points that are far away in one view, will show neighbours that are close together in the opposing view.

**diffusion**: points that are close in one view, will show neighbours that are far apart in the opposing view.

# Spatial Linked Brushes

.medium[
- The $k$ nearest neighbours graph can be pre-computed quickly, for either $X$, $Y$ or both.
- Instead of using the neighbour indices, we could use the neighbour distances instead
- Composition of multiple brushes could be used to show where there are matches/mismatches between nearest neighbour graphs
